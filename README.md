# Action Potential Detection Algorithm

***This code is for research purposes only.***

It is a Matlab code for an automated analysis algorithm to detect action potentials (APs) in a nerve and quantify its activity. The algorithm is based on template matching. The templates are automatically adapted to individual AP shapes that vary depending on the nerve fibers from which the AP originates, and the recording setup used. The algorithm was validated by quantifying vagus nerve activity recorded during in vivo experiments in a rat model.
